<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
<h2>Hello my name is David and on this site animals will be shown and facts given  about them!</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you like the facts given about the magnificent two animals I have on my site. I chose the jaguar and the black mamba snake because to me they are very unique living figures.I like how they live their life and how they get their food. I don't care what others think about the animal, I personally like the animals and I would have them as pets.</p>
<p><strong>Jaguars</strong> are known to eat deer, peccary, crocodiles, snakes, monkeys, deer, sloths, tapirs, turtles, eggs, frogs, fish and anything else they can catch. The <strong>jaguar</strong> is the third-largest living feline species, after the tiger and lion.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the <strong>black mamba</strong> is widely considered the world's deadliest snake. <strong>Black mambas live</strong> in the savannas and rocky hills of southern and eastern Africa. They are Africa's longest venomous snake, reaching up to 14 feet in length, although 8.2 feet is more the average.</p>
