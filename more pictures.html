<p><em>This particular page is just showing you more pictures of the two animals i have on my site i wanted to show my audience more pictures for them to know how these living things look they can be different colors suome times the jaguars are normally coated in some type of brown color with spots all over them and they can some times be black jaguars.The black mamba is also known as being a darker grey or sometimes blakc but this one is a lighter version of the balack mamba which is a regular grey color i like the lighter version of the black mamba because it makes the snake look incredible</em></p>
