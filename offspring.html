After about two weeks, the cubs are able to see for the first time. After six months, the cubs' mother will teach them how to hunt, and after their second birthday, the cub will leave their mother to live on their own.Baby jaguars learn to hunt from their mother, who will bring weakened deer and other animals to the den so that the cubs can practice their hunting skills. The mortality rate for baby jaguars is very high, and many are eaten by the large anaconda snakes that also live in the rain forests and jungles. After the first two years of life with their mother and siblings, jaguars will go off on their own to find their own hunting territories.Females have litters of one to four cubs, which are blind and helpless at birth. The mother stays with them and defends them fiercely from any animal that may approach—even their own father. Young jaguars learn to hunt by living with their mothers for two years or more.</p>

According to National Geographic, they can grow to be 14 feet long (4.25 meters), though their average length is around 8 feet (2.4 m). These giants can live up to 11 years in the wild. Just two drops of potent black mamba venom can kill a person</p>
